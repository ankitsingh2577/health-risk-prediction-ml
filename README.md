There are multiple medical instruments available within the marketplace for predicting heart conditions where there are two major problems with them which are as following: the primary one is that they are expensive enough to use, and the other is that they are not efficiently ready to calculate the possibility of cardiovascular disease in humans and other diseases such as Pneumonia, Malaria and  diseases. In many ways, the advancement in engineering science has brought tremendous opportunities, medical science is one of the fields where the engineering instrument can be used. Medical research has already used some of the major computer science resources available ; artificial intelligence has gained popularity in the last decade thanks to advancements in computing power. One such technique is machine learning, which is commonly used in various contexts since the multiple algorithms do not require various datasets. Reprogrammable machine learning capabilities add a lot of power and open up new possibilities for fields such as medical research. The purpose of this scoping analysis is to resolve this void and investigate the use of machine learning in rare diseases, exploring, for example, the application of machine learning to rare diseases, the kinds of algorithms and input data used or the study of medical applications (e.g. prediction, prognosis or treatment). These models would be able to predict a patient's future health hazards even sooner, so that they can take protective steps and enjoy a long, stable life.<br />

## Heart Disease
A disease is an unnatural medical disorder that impairs an organism's ability to function and is usually accompanied by symptoms of illness. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), heart disease and stroke are the world's leading causes of death and have remained so for the past 15 years. Machine Learning may provide remarkable features that simplify the recognition of unseen trends, ultimately providing clinical insights that assist physicians in preparing and providing treatment in the direction of predicting heart disease.<br />
The Heart Disease dataset has been taken from Kaggle. This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. It has a total number of 303 rows and 14 columns among which 165 have a heart disease.<br />

## Liver Disease
Any disruption of liver function that results in illness is referred to as liver disease. The liver is responsible for a number of vital functions in the body, and if it becomes ill or damaged, those functions can be lost, causing serious harm to the body. Excessive alcohol use, inhalation of toxic chemicals, consumption of tainted fruit, pickles, and medications have all contributed to an increase in patients with liver disease.<br />
This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Dataset" column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.<br />

## Breast Cancer
Breast cancer is more common in women than in men. A lump in the breast, bloody discharge from the nipple, and changes in the form or texture of the nipple or breast are all signs of breast cancer. Its treatment is determined by the cancer's level. Chemotherapy, radiation, hormone therapy, and surgery can all be used.<br />
The dataset has been taken from UCI machine learning repository. The main objective of the analysis is to perform classification of tumors i.e., benign(B) or malignant(M). A benign tumor is a tumor that does not invade its surrounding tissue or spread around the body. A malignant tumor is a tumor that may invade its surrounding tissue or spread around the body. This dataset consists of 569 rows and 33 columns.<br />
